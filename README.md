01 HTML CSS Homework: CODE REFACTORING


Description:

Refactor an existing site to meet the client's needs. The requirements are:
- find semantic HTML elemts
- find the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- accessible alt attributes
- heading attributes fall in sequential order
- concise and descriptive title 


Changes Made:

Cleaned index code structure by seperating, grouping, spacing and indentations to help seperate elements.

Group style attributes 

Documented changes in index.html and style.css

Updated title

Re-classified div attributes as 'header' , 'article' , 'aside' , 'footer' attributes to easily identify content

Identified 'ul' as 'nav' elements

Repaired 'Search Engine Optimization' link by assigning it an 'id' not a 'class'

Re-classified 'div class' to 'article class' because content is semantically related and self-containing

Assigned 'section id' to content in parent 'article class'

Added alt attributes to all imgs

Changed text color to reduce strain on eyes

Changed font size for better viewing

Issues/Improvements:

Had difficulty grouping elements in style .css

        - experimented with various class=''
        - probably an easy fix, open to all input
