Cleaned index code structure by seperating, grouping, adding spaces and indentations to help seperate elements.

Noted changes in index.html and style.css

Updated title

Re-classified div attributes as 'header' , 'article' , 'aside' , 'footer' attributes to easily identify content

Identified 'ul' as 'nav' elements and fixed 'Search Engine Optimization' link by assigning it an 'id' not a 'class'

Re-classified 'div class' to 'article class' because content is semantically related and self-containing

Assigned 'section id' to content in 'article class'

Added alt attributes to img in 'article class'

, 'aside'
